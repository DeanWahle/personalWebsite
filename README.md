This is a portfilio website developed by me! It includes an interactive timeline with my previous experience and education, as well as links to my Linkedin and my Github. Lastly, it has a "fitness" page that displays how many steps I have taken each day in the past week. This is achieved by making a request to the Fitbit API.
